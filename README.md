# LLM Distribution Shifts
--- 

This is my research project with the Madry Lab at MIT. This repo contains my initial code for my notebooks, logs, and scripts for running experiments. Within the logs contains fine-tuning runs like Qwen3-0.6B and TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 fine-tuned on GSM8K. It also contains comparison evals on datasets before and after fine-tuning.
